### Project Description:

This project extends previous lab exercises to develop a sophisticated stock portfolio suggestion engine. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, the engine analyzes financial news, reports, and historical data to offer personalized stock or ETF recommendations.

### User Interaction:

- Input an investment amount (minimum $5000 USD).
- Select one or two investment strategies (Ethical, Growth, Index, Quality, Value Investing).

### Technical Overview:

#### NLP and Machine Learning Integration:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes financial news to gauge market sentiment.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifies key financial entities in news articles.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Uses advanced algorithms to study past stock performance.

#### Stock Selection Algorithm:
- Maps investment strategies to relevant stocks or ETFs.
- **Example**: For Index Investing, suggests ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM).

#### Backend Technology:
- **.Net Framework**: Manages data processing and algorithm execution.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes SQL databases for storing user profiles and historical data.

#### Frontend Development:
- **React Application**: Ensures a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Implements charts and graphs for easy understanding of portfolio performance.

### Advanced Features:

#### Real-time Data Processing:
- Integrates APIs for real-time stock market data.
- Provides up-to-date portfolio suggestions based on current market conditions.

#### User Profile Customization:
- Allows users to set preferences for types of stocks/ETFs.
- Customizes suggestions based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

#### Security and Scalability:
- Implements robust security measures to protect user data.
- Scalable architecture to handle increasing user load.

### Deployment and Accessibility:
- Hosted on Amazon EC2 for reliable and continuous service.
- Optimized for various devices and browsers.

### Future Enhancements:
- Incorporating AI chatbots for user queries.
- Expanding the database to include global stocks and ETFs.

By detailing these technical aspects, your project description becomes more comprehensive, showcasing the depth and sophistication of your stock portfolio suggestion engine.
